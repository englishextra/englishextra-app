# Recreating the repo

## Backup files

Get current code remotely:

    git clone https://git01.codeplex.com/englishextraapp.git

Or do it manually on your local machine by copying files to temporary folder.

## Remove all history, keep the code in current state

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13716658/how-to-delete-all-commit-history-in-github>

Deleting the `.git` folder may cause problems in your git repository. If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:

    # Checkout
    git checkout --orphan latest_branch

    # Add all the files
    git add -A

    # Commit the changes
    git commit -am "commit message"

    # Delete the branch
    git branch -D master

    # Rename the current branch to master
    git branch -m master

    # Finally, force update your repository
    git push -f origin master

PS: this will not keep your old commit history around :)
